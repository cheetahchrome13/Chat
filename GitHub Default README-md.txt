# Project Title

This program creates two classes -- client and server, each class has a javafx stage that acts as a chatbox.
Methods and code in each class create threads and input/output streams which enable the two classes to send data
back and forth.

## Analysis Steps

This section should restate the assignment and explain how you analyzed the requirements in order 
to develop a solution.

### Design

I modified a classroom project to get two-way functionality out of the client/server setup
```
Give examples
```

### Testing

I tested this program at each change to see results. It was really a simple matter of making both classes nearly alike.
